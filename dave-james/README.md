# LAB03 jQuery with Events

**Author**: David Cerino & James Denton
**Version**: 1.0.0 (increment the patch/fix version number up if you make more commits past your first submission)

## Overview
Edit a blog site and use event handlers to filter through content by using Author and Category handles.

## Getting Started
Fork the Repo, clone the fork, create a new branch, and copy the starter code into a new folder.

## Architecture
We use JS, html, and jQuery.  We use the HTML to create a skeleton of the page, use three different JS files to create the content, one with the CONSTRUCTOR, another with data going into the CONSTRUCTOR, and another that renders that data into the page.
