#### Reflect and summarize on your process for each `TODO` item :  
  1. First, we worked on the daily kata.
  2. Next, we began pair programming on 03-jquery-with-events. We added the articleView.js in last position for js links, and then we built the list of authors for the author filter.
  3. Next, we switched driver and navigator. 
  4. We worked on the rest of the functions Thursday.
  5. Saturday morning we did the markdown files and submitted the assignment.
